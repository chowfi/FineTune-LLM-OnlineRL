# FineTune-LLM-OnlineRL

Game: Xiangqi

Main Idea - Fine-tuning LLM Agent with Online RL (PPO & LoRA) : 
1) Pre-trained LLMs are used as starting policy for RL agent
2) Observations from environments are converted to text
3) Text observations triggers an action and subsequently updates the RL agentâ€™s policy

Other Methods implemented:
1) Random 
2) Greedy 
3) DQN
4) DDQN
